# AGENTS.md

## Commands

CI runs the `just` recipes below, so run the same recipe locally before
you push. `just` with no argument lists every recipe.

- `just lint`: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` with
  warnings denied, and `helm lint` on both charts.
- `just test-unit`: `cargo test` at the workspace root. On the host it
  needs `g++`, because the `zmq` crate compiles a bundled libzmq.
- `just up`, `just test-smoke`, `just down`: build the image, create a
  kind cluster with both charts installed, run a CPU dummy-weights vLLM
  through `tests/e2e/smoke.sh`, and delete the cluster. The first image
  build compiles the `dynamo-kv-router` git dependency and takes a while.
- `just install-cli`: install `kinfctl` into `~/.cargo/bin`.

The end-to-end suite lives in a separate repository and reports as the
`e2e` check on a pull request. A push to a branch in this repository
starts the suite. A pull request from a fork starts it when a maintainer
comments `/e2e`. `docs/local-development.md` shows how to iterate against
the kind cluster and how to read the observation events.

## Architecture

`ARCHITECTURE.md` is the map of the server: how the code is grouped, which
way imports go and where new code goes. Read it before you add or move
code, and change it in the same pull request as any move.

## Prose style for all text, including commit messages and PR descriptions

- Write one main claim per sentence.
- Put reasons and asides in their own sentences instead of inserting them
  mid-sentence with dashes, parentheses, or relative clauses. Don’t use
  em-dashes.
- Every pronoun, “this/that/these,” or summarizing noun (“the two halves,”
  “both,” “this approach”) must have a single, explicit antecedent in the
  immediately preceding sentence. If there’s any doubt, repeat the noun.
- Don’t end paragraphs with summary or wrap-up sentences. If a conclusion
  depends on an assumption, state the assumption.
- Use active voice and name the actor: the client, the operator, the
  router. Inanimate subjects are fine with project terms such as
  "a worker set declares an alias".
- Keep the relativizer in object relative clauses: "the name that the
  client sent", not "the name the client sent".
- Use the project's own terms. Don't swap in metaphors such as
  "carries" for "declares".
- Name the concrete thing: "alias" or "model name", not just "name".
- Avoid noun stacks: "each endpoint's predicted time to first token",
  not "endpoint TTFT prediction metric".
- Keep words that depend on each other close: a verb near its subject
  and its complements, a modifier near the word it modifies. Move a
  long relative clause to the end of the sentence, or turn it into a
  leading condition: "when only one worker set declares a name, the
  router sends requests for that name to that set". Split a sentence
  whose one subject governs several far-apart verbs.

## Code comments and documentation

Comments in this repo are kept short on purpose. Target an overall Rust comment
ratio under 15%, with no module above ~25%.

### Write a comment only when it says something the code can't

Keep (and keep tight) comments that explain *why* something non-obvious is
done:

- Invariants and contracts a caller must respect.
- Concurrency and locking rules, lifecycle and leak bounds.
- Protocol quirks and wire formats
- Performance-sensitive choices and workarounds for upstream bugs.
- Units and ranges when the type doesn't make them clear.

When in doubt, leave the comment out.

### Don't write

- **History.** No "originally", "pre-refactor", "used to", "we changed X to
  Y", "now that...", bug stories or references to removed code. That goes in
  commit messages and PR descriptions.
- **Restatements.** No comment that repeats what the next line or the
  signature already says.
- **Essays.** No multi-paragraph docs arguing for a design on small types or
  functions. Don't explain why something lives in one module instead of
  another.
- **Cross-reference lists to keep in sync** ("used in three places, keep
  these in sync..."). Name the callers in one sentence if it matters.
- **Notes about the current task or change** ("added for the new X",
  "fix for the issue above", "TODO from review").

### Style

- Module docs (`//!`): one or two sentences of purpose, plus real invariants.
- Item docs (`///`): a brief contract. One line is usually enough; fields
  usually need nothing.
- Inline (`//`): only for the non-obvious why.
- Test docs: state what the test checks in one line, not why it was written.
- Plain sentences. No ad hoc bold/caps emphasis.

### Keep comments correct

When changing code, update or delete the comments that describe it in the
same change: renamed or removed items, moved logic, changed defaults. Never
leave a doc comment attached to the wrong item, and re-read edited comments
so they still parse as sentences.

## Logging

kinference logs through `tracing`. The chart runs at `info`, so the
operator reads every INFO, WARN and ERROR line in production. Log volume
should grow with events, not with traffic.

### Levels

- ERROR: something needs fixing, and kinference can't recover on its own.
- WARN: kinference is degraded or misconfigured. Log a WARN line once per
  cause, never once per request. Latch the line, or let a metric count the
  repeats.
- INFO: lifecycle and state changes. Examples are startup, readiness,
  shutdown, a worker or worker set coming or going, and a leadership
  change. Each event logs one INFO line. The request path never logs at
  INFO.
- DEBUG: per-request decisions.
- TRACE: per-event and per-frame detail, such as each KV event.

### Don't log

- An event that a metric already counts, unless the line adds context that
  the metric can't hold.
- An event that another line already logs. Log the event once, where the
  state changes.
- A task exiting on cancel, or a config value that the operator can read
  in the config file.
- A path that can't happen. Use `debug_assert!` or `unreachable!` instead.

### Messages and fields

- A message is one short lowercase phrase that says what happened:
  "worker added", "replay incomplete".
- Don't start a message with a module prefix. The subscriber already
  prints the target.
- Put values in fields, not in the message text.
- Don't explain the code in a message. When the operator has to change a
  setting, name the setting.
- No caps for emphasis and no em dashes.
- Use the same field names in every crate: `workerset`, `worker_id`,
  `req`, `model`, `error`.
- Record an error as `error = &err as &dyn StdError`, with
  `use std::error::Error as StdError;`. The subscriber then prints the
  error's sources too. The alias avoids a clash with each crate's own
  `Error` type.

## Issues

- `gh issue create` skips the issue forms. Before filing, read the form
  under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` that matches, and write the body with one
  section per field, in the form's order, headed by the field's label.
  Apply the form's labels with `--label`.

## Commits and pull requests

CONTRIBUTING.md holds every rule for commits, the sign-off, a branch's
history and pull request descriptions, and says what an agent may do
without being asked. Read it before you commit, push or open a pull
request.
