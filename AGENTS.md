## Commands

CI runs the `just` recipes below, so run the same recipe locally before
you push. `just` with no argument lists every recipe.

- `just lint`: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` with
  warnings denied, and `helm lint` on both charts.
- `just test-unit`: `cargo test` at the workspace root. On the host it
  needs `g++`, because the `zmq` crate compiles a bundled libzmq.
- `just up`, `just test-smoke`, `just down`: build the image, create a
  kind cluster with both charts installed, run a CPU dummy-weights vLLM
  through `tests/e2e/smoke.sh`, and delete the cluster. The first image
  build compiles the `dynamo-kv-router` git dependency and takes a while.
- `just install-cli`: install `kinfctl` into `~/.cargo/bin`.

The end-to-end suite lives in a separate repository and reports as the
`e2e` check on a pull request. A push to a branch in this repository
starts the suite. A pull request from a fork starts it when a maintainer
comments `/e2e`. `docs/local-development.md` shows how to iterate against
the kind cluster and how to read the observation events.

## Architecture

`ARCHITECTURE.md` is the map of the server: how the code is grouped, which
way imports go and where new code goes. Read it before you add or move
code, and change it in the same pull request as any move.

## Prose style for all text, including commit messages and PR descriptions

- Write one main claim per sentence.
- Put reasons and asides in their own sentences instead of inserting them
  mid-sentence with dashes, parentheses, or relative clauses. Don’t use
  em-dashes.
- Every pronoun, “this/that/these,” or summarizing noun (“the two halves,”
  “both,” “this approach”) must have a single, explicit antecedent in the
  immediately preceding sentence. If there’s any doubt, repeat the noun.
- Don’t end paragraphs with summary or wrap-up sentences. If a conclusion
  depends on an assumption, state the assumption.
- Use active voice and name the actor: the client, the operator, the
  router. Inanimate subjects are fine with project terms such as
  "a worker set declares an alias".
- Keep the relativizer in object relative clauses: "the name that the
  client sent", not "the name the client sent".
- Use the project's own terms. Don't swap in metaphors such as
  "carries" for "declares".
- Name the concrete thing: "alias" or "model name", not just "name".
- Avoid noun stacks: "each endpoint's predicted time to first token",
  not "endpoint TTFT prediction metric".
- Keep words that depend on each other close: a verb near its subject
  and its complements, a modifier near the word it modifies. Move a
  long relative clause to the end of the sentence, or turn it into a
  leading condition: "when only one worker set declares a name, the
  router sends requests for that name to that set". Split a sentence
  whose one subject governs several far-apart verbs.

## Code comments and documentation

Comments in this repo are kept short on purpose. Target an overall Rust comment
ratio under 15%, with no module above ~25%.

### Write a comment only when it says something the code can't

Keep (and keep tight) comments that explain *why* something non-obvious is
done:

- Invariants and contracts a caller must respect.
- Concurrency and locking rules, lifecycle and leak bounds.
- Protocol quirks and wire formats
- Performance-sensitive choices and workarounds for upstream bugs.
- Units and ranges when the type doesn't make them clear.

When in doubt, leave the comment out.

### Don't write

- **History.** No "originally", "pre-refactor", "used to", "we changed X to
  Y", "now that...", bug stories or references to removed code. That goes in
  commit messages and PR descriptions.
- **Restatements.** No comment that repeats what the next line or the
  signature already says.
- **Essays.** No multi-paragraph docs arguing for a design on small types or
  functions. Don't explain why something lives in one module instead of
  another.
- **Cross-reference lists to keep in sync** ("used in three places, keep
  these in sync..."). Name the callers in one sentence if it matters.
- **Notes about the current task or change** ("added for the new X",
  "fix for the issue above", "TODO from review").

### Style

- Module docs (`//!`): one or two sentences of purpose, plus real invariants.
- Item docs (`///`): a brief contract. One line is usually enough; fields
  usually need nothing.
- Inline (`//`): only for the non-obvious why.
- Test docs: state what the test checks in one line, not why it was written.
- Plain sentences. No ad hoc bold/caps emphasis.

### Keep comments correct

When changing code, update or delete the comments that describe it in the
same change: renamed or removed items, moved logic, changed defaults. Never
leave a doc comment attached to the wrong item, and re-read edited comments
so they still parse as sentences.

## Logging

kinference logs through `tracing`. The chart runs at `info`, so the
operator reads every INFO, WARN and ERROR line in production. Log volume
should grow with events, not with traffic.

### Levels

- ERROR: something needs fixing, and kinference can't recover on its own.
- WARN: kinference is degraded or misconfigured. Log a WARN line once per
  cause, never once per request. Latch the line, or let a metric count the
  repeats.
- INFO: lifecycle and state changes. Examples are startup, readiness,
  shutdown, a worker or worker set coming or going, and a leadership
  change. Each event logs one INFO line. The request path never logs at
  INFO.
- DEBUG: per-request decisions.
- TRACE: per-event and per-frame detail, such as each KV event.

### Don't log

- An event that a metric already counts, unless the line adds context that
  the metric can't hold.
- An event that another line already logs. Log the event once, where the
  state changes.
- A task exiting on cancel, or a config value that the operator can read
  in the config file.
- A path that can't happen. Use `debug_assert!` or `unreachable!` instead.

### Messages and fields

- A message is one short lowercase phrase that says what happened:
  "worker added", "replay incomplete".
- Don't start a message with a module prefix. The subscriber already
  prints the target.
- Put values in fields, not in the message text.
- Don't explain the code in a message. When the operator has to change a
  setting, name the setting.
- No caps for emphasis and no em dashes.
- Use the same field names in every crate: `workerset`, `worker_id`,
  `req`, `model`, `error`.
- Record an error as `error = &err as &dyn StdError`, with
  `use std::error::Error as StdError;`. The subscriber then prints the
  error's sources too. The alias avoids a clash with each crate's own
  `Error` type.

## Commits and pull requests

PRs are merged with a merge commit, not squashed. Each commit lands on
`main` as written, and the PR title and description become the merge
commit message. `git log --first-parent main` shows one merge commit per
PR, and `git revert -m 1` reverts a PR as a unit. A commit message and a
PR description therefore have different readers, and each one is written
for its own reader.

### Git safety

- Commit, push and open a pull request only when the request asks for
  it, and only as far as it asks. The request is the user's message, or
  the brief that started an unattended run.
  - A request for an answer, a review, a plan or a discussion asks for
    no git action. Leave the working tree and the branch as they are.
    A question such as "can we codify this?" is a request for an
    answer, not for a commit.
  - A request for a change asks for commits on the current branch, and
    for nothing beyond them.
  - A request for a pull request asks for the commits, one push of the
    branch and the opening of the pull request.
  - A request to fix an open pull request asks for new commits and a
    push to that pull request's branch.
- One request covers every commit that it needs. Don't stop before each
  commit to ask again, and don't make a commit that the request does
  not need.
- Run `just setup` once per clone. It installs the hook that adds the
  `Signed-off-by` trailer that the DCO check requires. Without the hook,
  make every commit with `git commit -s`.
- Never amend or rebase a commit that is already pushed, and never
  force-push, unless the request asks for it. A fix after a push goes in a new
  commit, or in a fixup commit that the user folds in before merging.
- Never run a destructive git command, such as `git reset --hard`,
  `git clean` or a branch deletion, unless the request asks for it.
- Add no attribution for the agent: no `Co-Authored-By` trailer naming a
  model and no "Generated with" line. The human who submits the change is
  accountable for it.

### Commits

- One logical change per commit: the feature or fix, its tests, docs and
  unrelated small fixes go in separate commits when they make sense on their
  own.
- Every commit builds and passes tests, so `git bisect` works.
- The message says what the commit changes and why, for that commit only.
  Subject line in the imperative, under ~72 characters; wrap the body at 72.
- Write the message for a reader who reaches the commit from `git blame`
  or `git bisect` and has not seen the PR. The body explains the change at
  the level of the code: what was wrong or missing, what the commit does
  about it, and why that way.
- Address review feedback with `git commit --fixup <sha>` and fold it in with
  `git rebase -i --autosquash` before merging. No "address review" or "fix
  typo" commits on the final branch.

### PR descriptions

The description is the merge commit message. Write it for a reader of
`git log --first-parent main`, who sees one entry per PR and does not open
the commits.

- Title: the whole change, in the imperative, under ~72 characters.
- Body: five labeled parts, in this order. Each label stands on its own
  line as plain text, followed by one or more paragraphs.
  1. `Problem`: what is wrong or missing today, and why it matters. Start
     from the symptom, not from the code.
  2. `Solution`: what is different once the PR is merged, as a reader of
     `main` sees it. For several commits, the overall shape. For one
     commit, a sentence or two that does not repeat the commit body.
  3. `Operator-visible changes`: config fields, environment variables,
     chart values, CRD fields, proto messages, metric names, and what an
     operator has to do about them.
  4. `Validation`: what you ran beyond CI, against what, and what you saw.
  5. `Issues`: `Closes #N` for each issue the PR closes, and work that the
     PR leaves out.
- A part that does not apply keeps its label and says in one sentence
  why it does not apply. "None. The change touches only Rust internals"
  tells the reader that the author checked.
- Don't repeat the commits' messages. The commits hold the code-level
  reasoning. A PR with one commit still gets a merge commit, and its body
  is a shorter summary of that commit, not a copy.
- No markdown headings, bold, checklists or review chatter. The body is a
  commit message, and markdown means nothing in `git log`.
  CONTRIBUTING.md shows two filled-in examples.
